Unity in diversity comes true when adversity is broken. We intend to start with a child and connect him/her with a child from different location to exchange learning, culture, surroundings, ideas and grow up being a better person with more facilities and opportunities.

Statement:
Our purpose is to connect a needy beneficiary to a PAL and a mentor, to facilitate the needy child development. Here we are trying to connect two children, a needy (from rural), and a PAL from urban (or well-off contributor). A mentor, who is a guardian of the PAL, helps the beneficiary in his academic/sports progress. We are building a solution to provide real time feedback to provide best utilization of the resources to beneficiary and motivation for mentor.
